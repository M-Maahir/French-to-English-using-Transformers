# French-to-English-using-Transformers

This is a simple English to French Translation model using transformers.
I tried to simply as possible to make it easier for one to evaluate and understand. Though the dataset isnt the best the code is coded sucha a way that it can use the code block to import and any dataset to fit the need of the transformer. It is more like a plug and play
